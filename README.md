# block-trix
*UNDER CONSTRUCTION* Tool for parsing DNA sequences of transgenic constructs and intelligently designing primer pairs.  

##Functions:
1. Perform sequence alignment to identify insertion site, known transgenes, recombination sites, and other motifs. 
2. Create primers with user-defined purpose. E.g. distinguish between wild-type allele and knock-in.
3. Maintain MySQL database of primers and expected band sizes.
